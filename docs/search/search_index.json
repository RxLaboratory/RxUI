Introduction We\u2019re proposing here some guidelines to build icons based on our experience with software development and UI design, and most of all our comitment to make our software as intuitive and user-friendly as possible, as well as accessible to most people. Hint All of this document and these thoughts are evolutive. Also, we\u2019re not omniscient, and you have your own thoughts and experience; we would be very happy if you would share them and contribute to this document, these guidelines, these list, and these icons. Together, we could make sure all our software is the best we can imagine. User-friendliness This is the most important aspect of our UI and icons. This means that after a short period of getting used to them, the user is as quick as possible using the software, which UI is unobtrusive. The UI and the icons must let as much as possible room to the actual work of the user (text, image, media\u2026) The UI must be as discreet as possible, and let the user\u2019s work area stand out. That means the icons has to be as small as possible while keeping readiness, and not being too difficult to click-on. They also must be constrasting enough, with other icons and with the rest of the application, to be recognizable as fast as possible. Accessible Not all users have the same way of seeing the icons. Some may be colorblind, some may have visual defficiencies. The default icons have to be as contrasted as possible, and use all tools available to help everyone differentiate them: colors, shapes, sizes. This also means that the UI and the icons should be scalable, and it should also be possible to change the contrast (without having to manually define all colors) Of course this may be a lot of work, especially for free software - we strongly believe it should be a priority of paid and proprietary software to build accessible UI for everyone - so the main focus may be to first build a working UI and icons following these guidelines, but it must be still easy enough for anyone to modify them and add the ability to edit them to make them more accessible. At least, the software should give access to its stylesheets and make it easy to change the one which is used, and also the source (SVG) of the icons and a way to change them too. Of course, help is always welcome for every free software! Intuitiveness To help the user get used to the software, its UI and icons, they must be as intuitive as possible. This means that there should be as little as possible things to learn, and the signification of as much as possible items should be easily deducible. We propose to base the icons on a set of predefined symbols, used across applications and tools, so that the user do not have to re-learn everything. Specific icons should use a subset and variations of the base symbols and a combination of basic visual elements (colors, shapes, badges\u2026) to make it easy to deduce what they\u2019re symbolizing. That being said, intuitiveness must come after user-friendliness as we believe it is more important that the software does not get in the way of the work of the user. Most of the time, it is preferrable to have software which takes a bit of time to learn but be quick to use it then, than a software which can be used as soon as it is installed but make the work slower.

Hint All of this document and these thoughts are evolutive. Also, we\u2019re not omniscient, and you have your own thoughts and experience; we would be very happy if you would share them and contribute to this document, these guidelines, these list, and these icons. Together, we could make sure all our software is the best we can imagine.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"icons/#user-friendliness","text":"This is the most important aspect of our UI and icons. This means that after a short period of getting used to them, the user is as quick as possible using the software, which UI is unobtrusive. The UI and the icons must let as much as possible room to the actual work of the user (text, image, media\u2026) The UI must be as discreet as possible, and let the user\u2019s work area stand out. That means the icons has to be as small as possible while keeping readiness, and not being too difficult to click-on. They also must be constrasting enough, with other icons and with the rest of the application, to be recognizable as fast as possible.","title":"User-friendliness"},{"location":"icons/#accessible","text":"Not all users have the same way of seeing the icons. Some may be colorblind, some may have visual defficiencies. The default icons have to be as contrasted as possible, and use all tools available to help everyone differentiate them: colors, shapes, sizes. This also means that the UI and the icons should be scalable, and it should also be possible to change the contrast (without having to manually define all colors) Of course this may be a lot of work, especially for free software - we strongly believe it should be a priority of paid and proprietary software to build accessible UI for everyone - so the main focus may be to first build a working UI and icons following these guidelines, but it must be still easy enough for anyone to modify them and add the ability to edit them to make them more accessible. At least, the software should give access to its stylesheets and make it easy to change the one which is used, and also the source (SVG) of the icons and a way to change them too. Of course, help is always welcome for every free software!","title":"Accessible"},{"location":"icons/#intuitiveness","text":"To help the user get used to the software, its UI and icons, they must be as intuitive as possible. This means that there should be as little as possible things to learn, and the signification of as much as possible items should be easily deducible. We propose to base the icons on a set of predefined symbols, used across applications and tools, so that the user do not have to re-learn everything. Specific icons should use a subset and variations of the base symbols and a combination of basic visual elements (colors, shapes, badges\u2026) to make it easy to deduce what they\u2019re symbolizing.

Equivalent values in other units are given in parentheses following values in acceptable units only when deemed necessary for the intended audience. Abbreviations such as sec, cc, or mps are avoided and only standard unit symbols, prefix symbols, unit names, and prefix names are used. Unit symbols are unaltered in the plural. Unit symbols are not followed by a period unless at the end of a sentence. Aspace or half-high dot is used to signify the multiplication of units. A solidus (i.e., slash), horizontal line, or negative exponent is used to signify the division of units. The solidus must not be repeated on the same line unless parentheses are used. Variables and quantity symbols are in italic type. Unit symbols are in roman type. Numbers should generally be written in roman type. These rules apply irrespective of the typeface used in the surrounding text. Superscripts and subscripts are in italic type if they represent variables, quantities, or running numbers. They are in roman type if they are descriptive. The combinations of letters \u201cppm,\u201d \u201cppb,\u201d and \u201cppt,\u201d and the terms part per million, part per billion, and part per trillion, and the like, are not used to express the values of quantities. Unit symbols (or names) are not modified by the addition of subscripts or other information. The following forms, for example, are used instead. The symbol % is used to represent simply the number 0.01. Unit symbols and unit names are not mixed and mathematical operations are not applied to unit names. proper: kg/m3, kg \u00b7 m-3, or kilogram per cubic meter improper: kilogram/m3, kg/cubic meter, kilogram/cubic meter, kg per m3, or kilogram per meter3. There is a space between the numerical value and unit symbol, even when the value is used in an adjectival sense, except in the case of superscript units for plane angle. The digits of numerical values having more than four digits on either side of the decimal marker are separated into groups of three using a thin, fixed space counting from both the left and right of the decimal marker. Commas are not used to separate digits into groups of three. Standardized quantity symbols are used. Similarly, standardized mathematical signs and symbols are used. More specifically, the base of \u201clog\u201d in equations is specified when required by writing log a x (meaning log to the base a of x), lb x (meaning log 2 x), ln x (meaning log e x), or lg x (meaning log 10 x). When the word \u201cweight\u201d is used, the intended meaning is clear.
